# Component: Dialogs
The dialogs component provides access to SA-MP's [dialog feature](
http://wiki.sa-mp.com/wiki/ShowPlayerDialog). It features both mid-level and high-level abstractions
for the common types of dialogs.

## Interface: Message
The `Message` class (defined in [message.js](message.js)) enables to to display a simple message in
a centered dialog on the player's screen. Keep in mind that this will completely obstruct their
in-game experience, so use it sparsely.

Example:
```javascript
let message = new Message('You have been playing for 6 hours!');
message.displayForPlayer(player).then(() => {
  // the player has dismissed the message 
});
```

## Interface: Question
The `Question` class (defined in [question.js](question.js)) enables you to ask the user a question
that they have to answer in an input box. The answer may be subject to a set of constraints. When
the player enters an invalid answer, they will be showed an explanation. They can try up to three
times before the question will be aborted.

Example:
```javascript
const myQuestion = {
    question: 'What is your favorite food?',
    message: 'Having tasty food is important, what do you prefer?',
    leftButton: 'Order',
    constraints: {
        // Minimum and maximum length of their answer.
        min: 3,
        max: 100,

        // Message to display when they entered an invalid answer.
        explanation: 'Come on! Your dish should be between 3 and 100 characters.',

        // Message to display if they failed to answer three times.
        abort: 'Sadness. Donuts it is!'
    }
};

Question.ask(player, myQuestion).then(answer => {
    if (answer)
        console.log(player.name + ' answered: ' + answer);
    else
        console.log(player.name + ' did not answer');
});
```

## Interface: QuestionSequence
The `QuestionSequence` class (defined in [question_sequence.js](question_sequence.js)) enables you
to ask the player a sequence of questions, for example because they have to give certain information
to create a group. A single promise is returned that will be resolved with all answers when given
and correct, or `NULL` when they abort.

Example:
```javascript
const firstQuestion = { /* same as in the Question example */ };
const secondQuestion = { /* another question */ };
const thirdQuestion = { /* and yet another one */ };

QuestionSequence.ask(player, [ firstQuestion, secondQuestion, thirdQuestion ]).then(answers => {
    if (answers)
        console.log(player.name + ' answered: ' + answers.join(', '));
    else
        console.log(player.name + ' did not fully answer');
});
```

## Appendix: Dialog interface
The `Dialog` class defined in [dialog.js](dialog.js) is not meant to be used by feature code. Please
use one of the more specific dialog-related classes instead, since that allows us to provide a
consistent experience to our players.

Not sure what you need? Consider this mapping of SA-MP dialog types:

  - **DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX**: Use a [Message](message.js) for simple dialogs. Yes/no prompts are not
    supported yet.
  - **DIALOG_STYLE_INPUT**: Not supported.
  - **DIALOG_STYLE_PASSWORD**: Not supported.
  - **DIALOG_STYLE_LIST**: Use the [Menu](/javascript/components/menu/) component.
  - **DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS**: Use the [Menu](/javascript/components/menu/) component.
  - **DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST**: Forbidden in Las Venturas Playground.
