# Leaderboards
Players spent time on Las Venturas Playground in a variety of ways. What they have in common is that
pretty much everyone is competitive in _some_ way. The leaderboards feature supports a number of
leaderboards that, on a rolling basis, are able to display who currently is the leading player (and
in most cases the next 49 players too) in a given category.

The boards are accessible using the `/top` command, and the data is computed directly from the
database, and then amended based on live information from the current in-game players. This allows
the leaderboard to feel "live", changing as players play their game.
