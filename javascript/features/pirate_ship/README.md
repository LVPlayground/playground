# Las Venturas Pirate Ship
The Pirate Ship is one of the iconic features of Las Venturas Playground: it's a safe haven in the
midst of a war zone, where people can stand to talk, idle, or collect money. It's also one of the
areas in which we see most bugs, as players keep finding way to take god mode with them.
