// board, due to the highly personalised nature of this data.

// The player's current time will be updated several times per second. The personal record will be
// updated when they pass through the next checkpoint. The position of all players, including the
// times between them, will be updated when any of the participants passes a checkpoint.

// time values will be displayed in green (they're doing better than the other time), whereas
// positive values will be displayed in red (they're doing worse than the other time).
