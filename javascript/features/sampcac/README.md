# SAMPCAC Integration
Las Venturas Playground has an optional integration with the SAMPCAC library, which used to be
documented on SAMPCAC.xyz which has since gone away.

While its own detectors are unmaintained, it does still detect a fair amount of the known cheating
tools out there, and has the ability to checksum GTA: San Andreas memory regions on the player's
client which can aid in writing further, manual detectors.

Las Venturas Playground will not mandate use of SAMPCAC, but we can request players under suspicion
to use it, and introduce rewards for players who do use it, as it can be seen as a sign of trust.
