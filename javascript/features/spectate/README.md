# Spectate
This feature encapsulates the ability to spectate other players on the server. This is available
for administrators on all times, but is also available for players in certain circumstances, for
example when they're observing games or other activities.

## Concept: _spectate groups_
When spectating, you have the ability to switch to other players in the _spectate group_. This could
mean any player on the server, for example when an administrator uses `/watch`, but when you are
spectating a certain fight or race, it will be limited to the game's participants.

A user interface will be exposed that tells you about the number of participants in the group, and
enables you to switch back and forth between them. Furthermore, the _fire_ key can be used to switch
to the previous player, and the _sprint_ key can be used to switch to the next one.
