/**
 * After their first connection to the server, the first thing visible to players is the class
 * selection screen. This basically provides the first impression players get from Las Venturas
 * Playground, and, as such, we have to take good care in handling this.
 *
 * There are various scenarios possible, for each of which we have to give a good class selection
 * experience. The number of edge-cases possible here is interesting.
 *
 * 1) The player is not registered.
 *    Show the normal class selection, allowing the player to select a skin, after which they're
 *    able to spawn.
 *
 * 2) The player is registered.
 *    a) The player has a fixed skin stored to their account.
 *       Show the "fixed skin" version of the class select, which looks identical but doesn't allow
 *       the player to iterate through the available skins.
 *
 *    b) There is no fixed skin known for the player.
 *       The player needs to be able to identify and select a skin of their liking at the same time.
 *       After they identify, class selection will continue as usual. If they request to spawn prior
 *       to logging in to their account, show a message about why they can't do this.
 *
 *    If the player joined with a nickname that isn't theirs and wants to play as a guest, we'll
 *    reset the class selection scenario to be equal to step (1).
 *
 * Class selection can also be invoked after the player has already spawned, for example when they
 * press on the "F4" shortcut. This will always bring them in the (1) scenario. In case the Account
 * system is disabled, the player will always end up in the (1) scenario as well.
