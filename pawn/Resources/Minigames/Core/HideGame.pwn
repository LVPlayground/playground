*  This minigame is quite fun. Crew members can start this minigame, giving     *
*  everyone 30 seconds to signup. The seeker gets to see the entire map while   *
*  the rest has x minutes to search for a place to hide. Once hidden, the       *
*  seeker spawns and they search everyone. If the seeker is close to a hidden   *
*  player, that player gets frozen and a pickup gets spawned above their head   *
*  If the seeker sees them, they runs into the pickup and the player loses.     *
*  This continues untill everyone is found.                                     *
*                                                                               *
