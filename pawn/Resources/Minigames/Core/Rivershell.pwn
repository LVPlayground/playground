*   Las Venturas Playground 2.90 - Rivershell Game. Based of the classic       *
*   SA:MP game that has proven to be quite fun, rivershell is a capture the    *
*   flag type minigame that involves two teams that have to capture eachothers *
*   boat which is parked across the river. The teams should be chosen          *
*   automatically, and should spawn at each side of the river. The score should*
*   be displayed in a neat little textdraw with a limit of say, up to 10.       *
*                                                                              *
