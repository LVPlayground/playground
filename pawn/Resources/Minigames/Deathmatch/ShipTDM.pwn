// Cargo Ship Team Deathmatch
//
// A great team-deathmatch like minigame where players spawn on
// the cargoship just east of San Fierro. Players automatically get
// devided in the teams, whereas each team got their own colour
// and skin. Nametags are hidden for people in other teams, creating
// a unique and exciting environment for a coolish minigame.
